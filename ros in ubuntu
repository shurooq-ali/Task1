Open the terminal on Ubuntu.
The Ros noetic install commands are copied command by order.

Installation
Configure your Ubuntu repositories
Configure your Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse." You can follow the Ubuntu guide for instructions on doing this.

Setup your sources.list
Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org.


sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
Set up your keys
sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
Installation
First, make sure your Debian package index is up-to-date:

sudo apt update

Now pick how much of ROS you would like to install.

I choose Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended) : Everything in Desktop plus 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception packages

 sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full



Environment setup
You must source this script in every bash terminal you use ROS in.
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

It can be convenient to automatically source this script every time a new shell is launched. These commands will do that for you. 
Bash

if you have more than one ROS distribution installed, ~/.bashrc must only source the setup.bash for the version you are currently using .

echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc

Upon completion of the installation check by the word roscore
